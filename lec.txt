Video Lecture Links
-------------------

This file contains links to video lectures stored on Google Drive and a 
synopsis of each lecture. Following the URL allows streaming or downloading 
the content. The lectures are organized sequentially on a weekly basis. 
Lectures will be released on a MWF schedule. Expect 3 lecture videos per 
week, occasionally 4 when optional lectures providing additional clarification 
material (mostly on lab assignments) are added. 

Most of the CS354 lectures will be recordings from fall 2020. Some will 
pertain specifically to spring 2021. If a lecture makes references to fall 
2020, please ignore it.

Be mindful that compressed video, streaming or download, is by its nature 
voluminous. Streaming quality and download speed is influenced by how busy 
servers and networks are.

Some lectures will be longer than 50 minutes. I am speaking more slowly than 
normal and injecting redundancy in anticipation of questions to enhance 
clarity and understanding. Setting playback speed to 1.25 or 1.5 will help 
students who desire faster pace. Skipping forward will also reduce playback 
time bypassing redundancy and elaboration if not needed.
