Video Lecture Links
-------------------

This file contains links to video lectures stored on Google Drive and a 
synopsis of each lecture. Following the URL allows streaming or downloading 
the content. The lectures are organized sequentially on a weekly basis. 
Lectures will be released on a MWF schedule. Expect 3 lecture videos per 
week, occasionally 4 when optional lectures providing additional clarification 
material (mostly on lab assignments) are added. 

Most of the CS354 lectures will be recordings from fall 2020. Some will 
pertain specifically to spring 2021. If a lecture makes references to fall 
2020, please ignore it.

Be mindful that compressed video, streaming or download, is by its nature 
voluminous. Streaming quality and download speed is influenced by how busy 
servers and networks are.

Some lectures will be longer than 50 minutes. I am speaking more slowly than 
normal and injecting redundancy in anticipation of questions to enhance 
clarity and understanding. Setting playback speed to 1.25 or 1.5 will help 
students who desire faster pace. Skipping forward will also reduce playback 
time bypassing redundancy and elaboration if not needed.

Lecture 3:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EWbov3wOkbfxMvMIamquLoLUPpfIgKL8/view?usp=sharing
System calls and user mode/kernel mode toggling.
Different flavors of process creation.
Process (i.e., running program), its stack and role.

Lecture 4:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kYF3GIdixp38WILDCe22GxwoqjthZTY4/view?usp=sharing
Role of XINU Lab frontend and backend machines.
Overview of hardware: CPU and main memory.

Lecture 5:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/11kmP3lwRMSyZFtWvWWVQ3nQqdvM1FeBx/view?usp=sharing
Overview of software: C preprocessor, compiler, assembler, CDECL caller/callee convention.

Lecture 6:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Z_fcMaAc88Om_KyUzxqnEG19BFfeTuj/view?usp=sharing
Hardware support for stack management on Galileo backends.
Boot loading, start.S, nulluser(), and XINU NULL process.

Lecture 7:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EaWAs2ZopzDecvd9ZLA2cWmMJRx-vz2C/view?usp=sharing
Wrap-up of software and hardware background review.
Isolation/protection: motivation.

Lecture 8:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/14-gwiFotB-NmQUPiIUtDyJsm95KNlm0F/view?usp=sharing
Isolation/protection: motivation (continued), hardware support.

Week 4

Lecture 9:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BPla5s39jTtRtp1jJkaPK0CboaDYXsPB/view?usp=sharing
Isolation/protection: hardware support (continued).
OS organization into upper and lower halves, two pathways for switching from user to
kernel mode.

Lecture 10:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jmvkxR-ENXIVp4Z9WEGlNsdhmhC1DrHH/view?usp=sharing
Software support for isolation/protection: per-process kernel stack.
Absence of isolation/protection in XINU.

Lecture 11:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j6VI2NMu7gfcfDwoFACqPjetUiByrv-S/view?usp=sharing
x86-specific features: privilege levels or rings.
GDT, and CS, DS, SS registers.
Software disabling of memory segmentation (base/limit) in XINU, Linux and Windows.
GDT setup in Linux and Windows.

Note: Lectures 11, 12, 13 will provide an overview of x86 hardware support, some
of which specifically relevant for isolation/protection. Lecture 14 will be an optional 
lecture that provides tutorial background on lab2 for those that may benefit from it.
It is important that you develop the skills to analyze problems and figure things out
on your own which can be gained through practice only. You should not need lecture 14 
but it will there in case you do.

Lecture 12:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1evZLkCi9wKMpaoJB-aV7zuRm4YBoe0Yi/view?usp=sharing
GDT setup in XINU.
XINU runs in x86 protected mode with isolation/protection hardware support but does not
utilize user mode: code, data, stack entries in GDT are configured with DPL value 00.
Function of IF and IOPL fields in EFLAGS register.
Role of IDT, reservation of interrupts numbers 0, ..., 31 for exceptions/faults.
Notion of synchronous vs. asynchronous interrupts.

Lecture 13:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Ith57OlsKl9NVQmU52ydkbbFmPBekvN/view?usp=sharing
Role of synchronous interrupts with interrupt number 0, 13, 14 in x86.
Difference between exceptions (or faults) and software interrupts.
General configuration of IDT in XINU, mapping of clock interrupt (i.e., system timer).

[Toward the end, I note that we modify chprio() in lab2 so that it becomes a trapped
system call. As you will know from lab2, we are modifying resume() and yield() into 
trapped system calls.]
